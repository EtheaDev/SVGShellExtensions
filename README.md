# SVG Shell Extensions [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-yellowgreen.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

**A collection of extensions tools for SVG files, integrated into Microsoft Windows Explorer (Vista, 7, 8 and 10):**

- a [Preview handler](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163487.aspx)  which allows you to see the SVG image without open it, in the "Preview Panel".
 
- a [Thumbnail handler](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/thumbnail-providers) which allows you to see the SVG image into Windows Explorer.

- an SVG-XML Text Editor to manually edit and preview the text of SVG files.

### Features ###
* Supports Windows Vista, 7, 8 and 10 (only for 64 bits).

* Themes (Dark and Light) according to user preferences of Windows Theme

***For a clean Setup close all the windows explorer instances which have the preview handler active or the preview handler was used (remember the dll remains in memory until the windows explorer was closed).***

### Manual Build and Installation (for Delphi developers) ###

If you have Delphi 10.4 Sydney, you can manually build the project:

***Warning: To build the DLL you need also other open-source projects***

- [SVGIconImageList](https://github.com/EtheaDev/SVGIconImageList)

- [Synedit](https://github.com/SynEdit/SynEdit)

To manually install the SVGShellExtensions.dll follow these steps:

1. Close all the windows explorer instances which have the preview handler active or the preview handler was used (remember the dll remains in memory until the windows explorer was closed).
  
2. If you have already used the installer uninstall the components from system.
     
3. To install manually the dll run the `Setup\Register64bit.bat` (run-as-administrator).

4. If you wanto to uninstall the dll you use the `Setup\UnRegister64Bit.bat`

5. When it's registered, you can continue to change code and rebuild the dll (beware to close all Explorer instances).
